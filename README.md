# Grubdash Server
### There is a company called Grubdash. They have a website where people can order food from local restaurants for delivery.
### This server provides backend support for their service, tracking order submissions and statuses.

## Tools and Dependencies
This project relies on the following key tools and libraries:
  - Node.js: node forms the basis of the application helping to manage packages and scripts
  - Express.js: the server instance is generated by Express; additional routing functionality is also implemented using the Express library
  - Data Storage: the repo provides sample data in proper format stored locally; in the future this data will be migrated to a remote relational database

## Spinning the Server
To run this server locally, clone this repo and run the following command in the terminal: 
`npm install`
`npm run start`
Alternatively, if one wants to see changes to the local repo implemented in real-time:
`npm run start:dev`
